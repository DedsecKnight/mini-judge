# Mini-Judge

## Introduction

-   A Python script that will automatically run your source code against a set of provided test cases.
-   Currently supports Java and C++.

## Requirements:

-   Python 3
-   Java (and/or C++) compiler

## Setup Guide

-   In the same directory as that which has the `.py` script, create a new folder called `test_cases`.
-   Place the source code that you want to test in the same directory as that containing the `.py` and `test_cases`.

## To create a test case

-   Create a new subfolder inside the `test_cases` directory.
-   Inside the new subfolder, create 2 new files with the following names:
    -   `p2in1.txt`: This will be the name of the input file.
    -   `p2out1.txt`: This will be the name of the expected output file.

## To run test case check

-   Make sure that all the steps in [Setup Guide](setup-guide) are completed.
-   Compile and execute the script file.
